# Medical Home Health Company Landing Page

I created a landing page for a local company's medical home health company. The landing page uses primarily CSS and HTML with a little bit of Javascript. It is still a work in progress and eventually I would like to make the "Contact Us" form actually send an email to the business owners. I eventually will also populate the various tabs at the top with other HTML files that correspond to the tabs.
